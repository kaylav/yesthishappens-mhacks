      <h2>WHAT IS YTH?</h2>
        <p>
          YTH is a forum tool designed to increase feelings of solidarity by
          allowing users to post experiences with racism, bullysing, sexism,
          homophobia, or other issues of prejudice. Other users can vote to
          'relate' to posts that are similar to experiences, as well as 'validate'
          other posts to show their support.
          <br><br>
          All posts can be 'flagged' for review if they contain sensitive or
          inappropriate content. Once a post has been flagged, it doesn't
          show up on the site until it's been reviewed by a moderator.
          The same process applies to comments.
          <br><br>
          Although anyone can read the site, to make a new post, a user must
          log in with a gmail account. This information is never displayed publicly,
          but allows moderators to track any users who frequently have their content flagged.
        </p>

      <h2>WHAT IS YOUR MISSION?</h2>
        <p>
          Every day, people all over the country experience prejudice. Some
          forms are blatant, like hate crimes or the use of slurs. However,
          a lot of these experiences aren't quite so clearly 'bad.'
          <br><br>
          A girl at a hackathon might realize that every boy she meets assumes
          she's a designer and not a real engineer. A professor might make an
          offhand comment about the queer community that leaves a closeted
          student with an 'off' feeling. A student with accessibility needs might
          have to skip office hours because they're held in a building with no wheelchair ramp.
          <br><br>
          When these smaller things happen, it's easy for people to feel alone,
          and even easier to assume it was some sort of fluke. Especially in
          liberal college bubbles, it's easy to brush incidents like this off,
          assuming that things like that don't actually happen with any frequency
          in the real world. However, things like this do happen, all the time.
          <br><br>
          We wanted to bring attention to these issues, as well as creating a
          community of solidarity for those affected by these incidents.
        </p>

      <h2>WHO ARE WE?</h2>
        <p>
          We are a group of females in computer science with a passion for
          social justice and making the world a more inclusive, supportive
          environment. We have each been minorities, whether that be as females
          in a male dominated field, or because of our race, sexuality, etc.
