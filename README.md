# yesthishappens-mhacks

Yes, This Happens is a forum tool designed to increase feelings of solidarity by allowing users to post experiences with racism, bullysing, sexism, homophobia, or other issues of prejudice. Other users can vote to 'relate' to posts that are similar to experiences, as well as 'validate' other posts to show their support.
